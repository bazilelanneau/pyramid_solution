# pyramid_solution
This repo contains my recursion-based solution to the "Pyramid Slide Down" problem in Python from codewars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/pyramid-slide-down/train/python

I created this solution entirely on my own. It is an honest representation of my knowledge of Python and my ability to apply recursion to a novel context.
