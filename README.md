# pyramid_solution
This repo contains my recursion-based solution to the "Pyramid Slide Down" problem in Python from codewars. In this problem, an array represents all the possible distances it would take to slide down from one level to the next on a pyramid. At any given position there is a left slide and a right slide, one of which must be chosen. The challenge is to write a function that can take any array representing one such pyramid and return the longest possible path from top to bottom.

The full problem description can be found at https://www.codewars.com/kata/pyramid-slide-down/train/python or by viewing pyramid_problem_description.png

I worked on this solution entirely on my own. It is an honest representation of my knowledge of Python and my ability to apply recursion to a novel context.
